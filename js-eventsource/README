======================================
HTML5 EventSource (Server-Sent Events)
Abstract: EventSource is an API for opening HTTP connections in order to receive push notifications from a server in the form of DOM Events
W3C Spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/

Usage: 
1. download js-eventsource
2. cd js-eventsource
3. run > bundle install
4. thin start

Now the server will be running on port 3000

Testing
1. go to localhost:3000 in Safari, Firefox or Chrome
2. you will see "no messages" continue to write itself on your screen
3. open a new browser window and go to localhost:3000/admin/list
4. click on Write Notification
5. write yourself a notification (note: should be plain text as there is no stripping of html entities currently, as this is just a demo)
6. press Send Notification
7. Watch as the notification is broadcast to you
