Basic Usage
1. cd to the directory where you checked out media/video (this directory)

To Parse Patterns in a Stream File
> ruby parse_h264_for_patterns.rb /path/to/stream/file.[pcap, stream, dump]

To Parse Example RTP Headers to find true RTP headers in a list of illegals and erroneous
> ruby parse_h264_for_headers.rb

- This is currently just a collection of real and broken RTP sequences in hex. You can add more headers to this, or test the collection of headers as STDIN or ARGV[n]

To Parse an actual FSV (FreeSwitch Video File) - Can be easily updated to just parse RTP
> ruby fsv_to_raw_h264.rb ./fsv/record_fsv_h264.fsv

Notes: The output of the fsv_to_raw_h264.rb will generate an depacketized raw h264 video file as output. Ensure this directory allows ruby write permissions.
