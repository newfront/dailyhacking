This example shows how to depacketize a stream capture file (think pcap), in this case the file format is the fsv (Freeswitch Video Format for Freeswitch SIP Server)

You can easily modify the read_fsv_to_bin.rb file to ignore the fsv header and just parse your RTP capture file. 

- Note: This depacketizer is for h263 / RTP packetization.

The output of this parser will be a new file of raw h263. ( You can feed this into FFMPEG or GStreamer to generate any movie file you want )

These learnings can be used free of charge.
