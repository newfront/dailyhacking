running the server is simple
> thin start

users can connect through the url /
this will automatically log them into a session, using eventsource 301 redirect

pushing a notification is currently just for example

/notification/:uuid/new where uuid is the uuid of a user's session

If a user is connected without any notifications, then NotificationQueue will throttle the Javascript EventSource reply field up to 50000. This can be updated currently in the libs/notification_queue.rb, I could move to config file at a later point.

Enjoy.
